import a GUI-wallet account
======================================



Without already having an account, or knowing someone that has an account, it is not possible. You canâ€™t create accounts out of nowhere.

But you can work around it by importing an active key of a **Lifetime Member** account that has funds:

**GUI**

#. In the GUI, open the side menu
#. Select the [Permissions] of an account that is funded and has a LTM status
#. Click on the public key on the ACTIVE tab. It opens a private key viewer.
#. Click [Show] and copy the private key. (with Login)


**CLI**

#. In the cli-wallet run a command: ``import_key <account_name> <private_key>``
#. Then run: ``suggest_brain_key`` and copy the brain key. (You might want to make a backup of your brain key somewhere.)
#. Create a new account with this command: ``create_account_with_brain_key <brainkey> <new_account_name> <imported_name> <imported_name> true``


This will create a new account called \<new_account_name\> and set the registrar and referrer to \<imported_name\>. The brainkey can be used to regenerate the account (even in the GUI wallet). You can manually delete the other active key from the wallet.json file.
