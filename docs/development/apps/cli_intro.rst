The Nodes are connected to the network and verify all transactions and block produces. The cli_wallet does not offer P2P or blockchain capabilities.  

Launching the cli_wallet requires a trusted Full Node to interact with the blockchain. You might use a localhost or own node to connect. Also, you can select one of `LocalCoin Public Full Nodes <https://github.com/localcoin/localcoin-ui/blob/staging/app/api/apiConfig.js#L67>`_, or use API Server that runs by _businesses_ or _individuals_.

When you start the cli_wallet first time, it creates a local ``wallet.json`` file that contains the encrypted private keys. The key is required to access the funds and add new data to the blockchain with a signature from a private key.
